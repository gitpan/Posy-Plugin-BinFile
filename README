==== NAME ====

Posy::Plugin::BinFile - Posy plugin to serve (binary) non-entry files


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.50'' of Posy::Plugin::BinFile.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

This plugin renders non-entry files (the 'file' path-type), giving the
correct MIME-type for the requested file -- if the file exists in the data
directory.

This allows you to (a) integrate existing web-pages into a Posy site by
putting them into the data_dir(*) (b) include image files alongside entry
files by putting them in the same directory (and reference them with
relative paths just as you would normally).

This depends on the FileStats plugin for the MIME-type information for the
files.

(*) Note that since Posy recognises and processes '.html' and '.txt' files
by default, if you want such files to be processed as raw files and not as
Posy-entry files, you need to give them different extensions.

This plugin replaces a number of methods, adding in code for dealing with
'file' path-type files. There is no need to add extra actions.


==   Configuration   ==

This expects configuration settings in the $self->{config} hash, which, in
the default Posy setup, can be defined in the main "config" file in the data
directory.

``static_file_default_type''
What is the default MIME type for a file when it can't determine the type?
